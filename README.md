# VS-NET-Inheritance

This program will create a instance of the class Dog which has no instant variable/members and no
access modifiers/properties such as getter/setters/ access methods. However since the class Dog 
inherits from the parent class Animal therefore Dog object would operate with the Animal class's
access methods/properties/getter/setters and data members/instant variables.
